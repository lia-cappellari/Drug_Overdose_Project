# Drug Overdose Project 

## Overview 
Our Team conducted a study to analyze the circumstances surrounding drug overdose cases. The goal is to identify key contributing factors and 
subsequently provide plausible recommendations to reduce the occurrences of this unfortunate event. Understanding how demographics, locations, 
and the substances involved link up in drug overdoses is crucial to craft effective prevention and intervention plans. By analyzing these occurrences, 
we hope to provide insights that can help public health officials, policymakers, and healthcare practitioners roll out specific measures to save lives 
and build healthier communities. Only the key findings from our analysis are found in this report.

## Main Research Question
What multifaceted factors, including geographic trends, temporal variations, and specific substance combinations, contribute to drug overdoses, and 
how can the understanding of these factors inform targeted interventions to reduce the incidence of fatal overdoses and improve public health outcomes?

## Areas of Focus
1. Geographic Trends in Drug Overdose Occurrences: Utilize location data to identify clusters or hotspots of fatal overdoses. Analyze whether certain
regions or communities are disproportionately affected.
3. Temporal Variations in Drug Overdose Occurrences:Conduct a time series analysis to explore changes in drug overdose occurrences over time.
Identify trends, fluctuations, or sudden spikes. Investigate whether there are seasonal or cyclical patterns in drug overdoses. Are there particular
times of the year or specific events that coincide with increased occurrences?
5. Combinations of Drugs: Examine data to identify common combinations of drugs involved in overdoses. Explore which combinations are more lethal and
whether certain substances enhance the toxicity of others.Investigate trends in polydrug use, considering how the simultaneous use of multiple
substances contributes to overdose incidents. Investigate the correlation between demographic groups and the types of substances involved in overdoses.
For example, are certain substances more prevalent among specific age groups or genders?
